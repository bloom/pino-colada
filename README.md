# Usage
Pipe a server that uses pino into pino-colada for logging.

```bash
node server.js | pino-colada
```

# Getting more detail
You can show select headers for each request by setting the environment variable `SHOW_HTTP_HEADERS` to true. Some common and noisy headers, like user-agent, are excluded. Excluded headers can be pretty easily found in the source code.
